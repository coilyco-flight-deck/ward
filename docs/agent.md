# ward agent

`ward agent <name> work <issue>` is the short verb over [`ward container`](container.md)
for the common case: take a Forgejo issue and put an agent on it end to end. One
line replaces the full `container up <repo> --mode <m> --branch <b>` stack plus a
hand-written prompt.

## Usage

```bash
ward agent claude work coilyco-flight-deck/ward#98
ward agent claude work https://forgejo.coilysiren.me/coilyco-flight-deck/ward/issues/98
ward agent claude headless coilyco-flight-deck/ward#98          # detached, fire-and-forget
ward agent codex  work coilyco-flight-deck/ward#98 --print      # resolve + show the plan, run nothing
```

`<name>` is the agent/mode (`claude|codex|qwen`, the same context ladder as
`container up --mode`). The issue ref is `owner/repo#N` or a full Forgejo issue
URL.

## What `work` does

1. **Resolve + validate.** Parses the ref, then fetches the issue from Forgejo so
   a bad ref, a typo, or an untrusted owner fails *before* any container spins.
2. **Trust-gate.** The target is refused unless its owner is in ward's primary-org
   set, because the container runs under `bypassPermissions` - the same gate
   `ward dispatch` applies. A non-`open` issue warns but proceeds.
3. **Branch.** Derives `issue-<N>` as the feature branch (override with `--branch`).
4. **Launch.** Spins up an interactive `ward container` against a fresh clone of
   the repo, seeded with a "read the issue, then carry it to merge" prompt.

The seed prompt rides as the in-container agent's argv (the entrypoint's
`"$WARD_AGENT" "$@"`), so the agent opens already pointed at the issue. The
container doctrine
([AGENTS.container.md](../cmd/ward/containerassets/AGENTS.container.md)) supplies
the carry-to-merge autonomy and the reaper backstop; `work` only seeds the issue.

## work vs headless

- **`work`** (interactive) attaches the container to your terminal - you watch
  the agent and can step in. `--detach` backgrounds it.
- **`headless`** is fire-and-forget: it always detaches and runs the agent in
  print mode (`claude -p`), so it works to completion non-interactively and exits
  into the reaper. It **streams live progress** (one line per tool call + the
  result, via stream-json) to the container log - `docker logs <name>` /
  `ward container exec` - so it isn't silent until done.
- **`task`** files an issue from `--instructions` first, then runs the `headless`
  flow against it (carries to merge, `closes #N`). See [docs/agent-task.md](agent-task.md).

The reaper backstop salvages residual work if the agent crashes (it needs ward's
jail off in-container - the entrypoint exports `CLIGUARD_NO_SANDBOX=1`, cli-guard#153).
The happy path doesn't rely on it: the agent commits/merges/pushes itself per its
doctrine, finishing to a clean `main` push.

## Credentials and user

claude runs **non-root** (uid 1000): it refuses `--dangerously-skip-permissions`
as root, so the entrypoint sets up as root then drops via `setpriv`. It
authenticates with your **Max/subscription login**, not an API key - ward
resolves the OAuth credential on the host (macOS keychain `Claude Code-credentials`,
else `~/.claude/.credentials.json`) and injects it into the container's
`~/.claude/.credentials.json` via the private `--env-file`, never in argv/audit.
`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` stays unset so it can't shadow OAuth.

## Flags

`work` carries the `container up` launch flags: `--aws`, `--detach`,
`--tag`/`--image`, `--ward-source`, `--no-pull`, and `--branch` to override the
`issue-<N>` default. `--print` resolves the issue and renders the seeded prompt +
docker plan without injecting the push token or running docker - the dry-run
preview, safe with no docker daemon up.

## Container name

Where a bare `container up` names its container `ward-<repo>-<rand>`, an agent
run names it for the work it carries: `ward-<repo>-issue-<N>-<mode>-<rand>`. So
`docker ps` reads the repo, the issue, and the harness at a glance, and a host
driving several agents at once can tell them apart - the `<rand>` suffix still
keeps concurrent runs on the same issue from colliding. `task` shows the shape
as `ward-<repo>-issue-<N>-<mode>-<rand>` under `--print`; the real number lands
once the issue is filed.

  against an issue in the canonical checkout instead of a fresh container.
