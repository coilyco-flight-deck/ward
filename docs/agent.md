# ward agent

`ward agent <name> work <issue>` is the short verb over [`ward container`](container.md)
for the common case: take a Forgejo issue and put an agent on it end to end. One
line replaces the full `container up <repo> --mode <m> --branch <b>` stack plus a
hand-written prompt.

## Usage

```bash
ward agent claude work coilyco-flight-deck/ward#98
ward agent claude work https://forgejo.coilysiren.me/coilyco-flight-deck/ward/issues/98
ward agent codex  work coilyco-flight-deck/ward#98 --print   # resolve + show the plan, run nothing
```

`<name>` is the agent/mode (`claude|codex|qwen`, the same context ladder as
`container up --mode`). The issue ref is `owner/repo#N` or a full Forgejo issue
URL.

## What `work` does

1. **Resolve + validate.** Parses the ref, then fetches the issue from Forgejo so
   a bad ref, a typo, or an untrusted owner fails *before* any container spins.
2. **Trust-gate.** The target is refused unless its owner is in ward's primary-org
   set, because the container runs under `bypassPermissions` - the same gate
   `ward dispatch` applies. A non-`open` issue warns but proceeds.
3. **Branch.** Derives `issue-<N>` as the feature branch (override with `--branch`).
4. **Launch.** Spins up an interactive `ward container` against a fresh clone of
   the repo, seeded with a "read the issue, then carry it to merge" prompt.

The seed prompt rides as the in-container agent's argv (the entrypoint's
`"$WARD_AGENT" "$@"`), so the agent opens already pointed at the issue. The
container doctrine
([AGENTS.container.md](../cmd/ward/containerassets/AGENTS.container.md)) supplies
the carry-to-merge autonomy and the reaper backstop - `work` only adds the
issue-seeding on top.

## Flags

`work` carries the `container up` launch flags: `--aws`, `--detach`,
`--tag`/`--image`, `--ward-source`, `--no-pull`, and `--branch` to override the
`issue-<N>` default. `--print` resolves the issue and renders the seeded prompt +
docker plan without injecting the push token or running docker - the dry-run
preview, safe with no docker daemon up.

  against an issue in the canonical checkout instead of a fresh container.
